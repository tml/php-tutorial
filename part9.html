      	<h2>Hard choices</h2>
	<p>If you’ve been paying attention, you now know how to use PHP’s MySQL
	API to perform queries and process result sets. You might even have
	started thinking about how to re-program your site to run off a MySQL
	database. All of this is a Good Thing – it means you’re getting
	comfortable with using PHP’s database support to power your
	applications – but there’s still a little further to go.</p>
	<p>As you saw in <a href="part8.html">Part Eight</a>, enabling
	MySQL support in PHP 5.0 is not as simple as
	it used to be. Instead of supporting MySQL out of the box, PHP now
	requires you to make all kinds of decisions about versions and
	libraries before allowing you to hook your scripts up to a MySQL
	database. If you’re lazy (and deep down, we both know you are), you
	might instead prefer to try a simpler option: the SQLite database engine.</p>
	<p>Built-in SQLite support is new to PHP 5.0, and offers users a
	lightweight database system that is fast, efficient and gets the
	job done. Since it’s enabled by default in PHP 5.0, it provides a
	viable alternative to MySQL; you can use it out of the box, without
	spending time on version checks and library downloads; just install PHP 5
	and start typing. That’s why I’m devoting a whole tutorial to it -
	so get out of bed, make yourself some coffee and let’s get started!</p>

	<h2>Making new friends</h2>
	<p>Before getting into the code, let’s make sure that you have a clear
	idea of what SQLite is (and isn’t). Unlike MySQL, which operates on a
	client-server paradigm, SQLite is a file-based database engine and uses
	file I/O (input/output) functions to store and read databases from
	files on disk. It’s also much, much smaller than MySQL – the
	command-line version of SQLite weighs in at under 200 KB – and
	supports most of the SQL commands you’re used to.</p>
	<p>This small size shouldn’t deceive you, however – according to
	<a href="http://sqlite.org/">the official SQLite Web site</a>,
	SQLite supports databases up to 2 terabytes in size and is actually
	faster than MySQL in certain situations. SQLite database files are easily
	portable, and SQLite databases created on Windows work fine on *NIX
	platforms and vice-versa.</p>
	<p>One of SQLite’s more interesting aspects is that it is completely
	typeless. Fields in an SQLite database need not be
	associated with a specific type, and even if they are, you can still
	insert values of different types into them (there is one exception to
	this rule, but I’ll get to that later). This is important, because it
	means that if you’re concerned about values of the wrong type getting
	into your tables, you need to write code to implement type checking in
	your application.</p>
	<p>Another important difference between MySQL and SQLite lies in their
	licensing policies: unlike MySQL, SQLite source code is completely
	public-domain, which means that you can use and distribute it however
	you choose in both commercial and non-commercial products. Take a look at
	<a href="http://sqlite.org/copyright.html">http://sqlite.org/copyright.html</a>
	for more on this.</p>
	<p>In order to use SQLite and PHP together, your PHP build must include
	SQLite. This is enabled by default in both the UNIX and Windows versions
	of PHP 5. Read more about this at <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.sqlite.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.sqlite.php</a>.
	If you’re a PHP 4.x user, though, don’t lose heart – you can still use SQLite,
	by manually downloading and installing php_sqlite.dll from <a href="http://snaps.php.net">http://snaps.php.net</a>
	(Windows) or the latest tarball from <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/SQLite">http://pecl.php.net/package/SQLite</a>
	(UNIX). You don’t need to download anything else; the SQLite ‘client’ is its own engine.</p>

	<h2>The bookworm turns</h2>
	<p>As with MySQL, you use regular SQL commands to interact with an
	SQLite database. The exact SQL syntax used by SQLite is listed
	at <a href="http://sqlite.org/lang.html">http://sqlite.org/lang.html</a>,
	but for most operations SQL commands are standard.</p>
	<p>Here’s an example, which sets up the table I’ll be using in this
	tutorial:</p>
	<code>C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\sqlite>sqlite library.db
SQLite version 2.8.15
Enter ".help" for instructions
sqlite> create table books (
	...> id integer primary key,
	...> title varchar(255) not null,
	...> author varchar(255) not null
	...>);
sqlite> insert into books (title, author) values ('The Lord Of The Rings', 'J.R.R. Tolkien');
sqlite> insert into books (title, author) values ('The Murders In The Rue Morgue', 'Edgar Allen Poe');
sqlite> insert into books (title, author) values ('Three Men In A Boat', 'Jerome K. Jerome');
sqlite> insert into books (title, author) values ('A Study In Scarlet', 'Arthur Conan Doyle');
sqlite> insert into books (title, author) values ('Alice In Wonderland', 'Lewis Carroll');
sqlite> .exit
</code>
	<p>You can enter these commands either interactively or
	non-interactively through the SQLite commandline program,
	which is available at <a href="http://sqlite.org/download.html">http://sqlite.org/download.html</a>
	as a precompiled binary for Windows and Linux. SQLite 2.* is the
	version currently used in both branches of PHP, with SQLite 3.* support
	anticipated for PDO and later PHP 5.* releases.</p>
	<p>Extract the downloaded files to a directory of your choice, cd into it from
	your shell or DOS box and type ‘sqlite’. You should see the SQLite version
	information and the line:</p>
	<pre>Enter ".help" for instructions</pre>
	<p>Read	<a href="http://sqlite.org/sqlite.html">http://sqlite.org/sqlite.html</a>
	for more information on how to use the commandline program.</p>
	<p>Once the data has been imported into the database file
	library.db, run a quick SELECT
	query to check if everything is working as it should:</p>
	<pre>sqlite> select * from books;
1|The Lord Of The Rings|J.R.R. Tolkien
2|The Murders In The Rue Morgue|Edgar Allen Poe
3|Three Men In A Boat|Jerome K. Jerome
4|A Study In Scarlet|Arthur Conan Doyle
5|Alice In Wonderland|Lewis Carroll
</pre>
	<p>If you saw the same output as above, you’re good to go!</p>

	<h2>Anatomy Class</h2>
	<p>Now, use PHP to communicate with SQLite, generate the same result
	set and format it as an HTML page. Here’s the code:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set path of database file
$db = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/../library.db";
// open database file
$handle = sqlite_open($db) or die("Could not open database");
// generate query string
$query = "SELECT * FROM books";
// execute query
$result = sqlite_query($handle, $query) or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
// if rows exist
if (sqlite_num_rows($result) > 0) {
	// get each row as an array
	// print values
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	while($row = sqlite_fetch_array($result)) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>".$row[0]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[1]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[2]."</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
}
// all done
// close database file
sqlite_close($handle);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>If all goes well, you should see something like this:</p>
	<img src="images/part9-table1.png" alt="Table">
	<p>If you remember what you learned in <a href="part8.html">Part Eight</a>,
	the PHP script above should be easy to decipher. In case you don’t, here’s a fast rundown:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>The ball starts rolling with the sqlite_open() function, which
		accepts the name of the database file as argument and attempts to open
		it. If this database file cannot be found, an empty database file will
		be created with the supplied name (assuming the script has write access
		to the directory).</p>
		{% highlight php %}<?php
$db = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/../library.db";
$handle = sqlite_open($db) or die("Could not open database");
?>{% endhighlight %}
		<p>The database file library.db needs to be kept somewhere it
		can’t be accessed through the browser by visitors to your site. That
		means that you need to create it outside your public_html, www or
		htdocs directory, in a directory that allows your scripts read/write
		permissions. Web hosting companies generally will offer a space above
		your web-visible directory where you can do this.</p>
		<p>$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/.." is the directory
		directly above your web-visible directory.</p>
		<p>If successful, the sqlite_open() function returns a handle
		to the file, which is stored in the variable $handle and
		is used for all subsequent communication with the database.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>The next step is to create and execute the query, with the
		sqlite_query() function.</p>
		{% highlight php %}<?php
$query = "SELECT * FROM books";
$result = sqlite_query($handle, $query) or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
?>{% endhighlight %}
		<p>This function also needs two parameters: the database handle and the
		query string. Depending on whether or not the query was successful, the
		function returns true or false; in the event of a failure, the
		sqlite_error_string() and sqlite_last_error()
		functions can be used to display the error that took place.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>If sqlite_query() is successful, the result set returned by the
		query is stored in the variable $result. You can retrieve the records
		in the result set with the sqlite_fetch_array() function, which
		fetches a single row of data as an array called $row. Fields in that
		record are represented as array elements, and can be accessed using
		standard index notation.</p>
		<p>Each time you call sqlite_fetch_array(), the next record in the
		result set is returned. This makes sqlite_fetch_array() very suitable
		for use in a while() loop, in much the same way as
		mysql_fetch_row() was used earlier.</p>
		{% highlight php %}<?php
if (sqlite_num_rows($result) > 0) {
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	while($row = sqlite_fetch_array($result)) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>".$row[0]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[1]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[2]."</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
}
?>{% endhighlight %}
		<p>The number of records returned by the query can be retrieved with
		the sqlite_num_rows() function. Or, if what you’re really interested in
		is the number of fields in the result set, use the sqlite_num_fields()
		function instead. Of course, these are only applicable with queries
		that actually return records; it doesn’t really make sense to use them
		with INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE queries.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Once you’re done, it’s a good idea to close the database handle and return
		the used memory to the system, with a call to sqlite_close():</p>
		{% highlight php %}<?php
sqlite_close($handle);
?>{% endhighlight %}
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>In PHP 5 you can also use the SQLite API in an object-oriented way,
	wherein each of the functions above becomes a method of the
	SQLiteDatabase() object. Take a look at this next listing,
	which is equivalent to the one above:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set path of database file
$file = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/../library.db";
// create database object
$db = new SQLiteDatabase($file) or die("Could not open database");
// generate query string
$query = "SELECT *  FROM books";
// execute query
// return result object
$result = $db->query($query) or die("Error in query");
// if rows exist
if ($result->numRows() > 0) {
	// get each row as an array
	// print values
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	while($row = $result->fetch()) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>".$row[0]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[1]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[2]."</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
}
// all done
// destroy database object
unset($db);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Here, the new keyword is used to instantiate an object
	of the class SQLiteDatabase() by passing the object
	constructor the name of the database file. If the database file does
	not already exist, a new database file is created. The resulting object,
	stored in $db, then exposes methods and properties to
	perform queries. Every query returns an instance of the class
	SQLiteResult(), which in turn exposes methods for
	fetching and processing records.</p>
	<p>If you look closely at the two scripts above, you’ll see the numerous
	similarities between the procedural function names and the object method
	names. While the correspondence between the two is not perfect, it’s
	usually close enough to make it possible to guess the one if you know the other.</p>

	<h2>Different strokes</h2>
	<p>As with the MySQL API, PHP’s SQLite API offers you more than one way to
	skin a cat. For example, you can retrieve each row as an object with the
	sqlite_fetch_object() method, and access field values
	by using the field names as object properties. Here’s an example:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set path of database file
$db = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/../library.db";
// open database file
$handle = sqlite_open($db) or die("Could not open database");
// generate query string
$query = "SELECT * FROM books";
// execute query
$result = sqlite_query($handle, $query) or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
// if rows exist
if (sqlite_num_rows($result) > 0) {
	// get each row as an object
	// print field values as object properties
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	while($obj = sqlite_fetch_object($result)) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>".$obj->id."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$obj->title."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$obj->author."</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
}
// all done
// close database file
sqlite_close($handle);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Another option is to retrieve the complete result set in one fell
	swoop with the sqlite_fetch_all() function. This function
	retrieves the complete set of records as an array of arrays; each
	element of the outer array represents a record, and is itself
	structured as an array whose elements represent fields in that record.</p>
	<p>Here’s an example, which might make this clearer:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set path of database file
$db = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/../library.db";
// open database file
$handle = sqlite_open($db) or die("Could not open database");
// generate query string
$query = "SELECT * FROM books";
// execute query
$result = sqlite_query($handle, $query) or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
// get the complete result set as a series of nested arrays
$data = sqlite_fetch_all($result);
// all done
// close database file
sqlite_close($handle);
// check the array to see if it contains at least one record
if (sizeof($data) > 0) {
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	// iterate over outer array (rows)
	// print values for each element of inner array (columns)
	foreach ($data as $row) {
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>".$row[0]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[1]."</td>";
		echo "<td>".$row[2]."</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
}
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>In all the previous examples, the database remained open while the
	result set was processed, because records were retrieved one after
	another with the sqlite_fetch_array() or
	sqlite_fetch_object() functions. The example above is unique
	in that the database can be closed before the result set array is processed.
	This is because the entire result set is retrieved at once and stored in the
	$data array, so there really isn’t any need to leave the database
	open while processing it.</p>
	<p>If your result set contains only a single field, use the
	sqlite_fetch_single()function, which retrieves the value of the first
	field of a row. The PHP manual puts it best when it says “this is the
	most optimal way to retrieve data when you are only interested in the
	values from a single column of data.” Take a look:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set path of database file
$db = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/../library.db";
// open database file
$handle = sqlite_open($db) or die("Could not open database");
// generate query string
// this query returns only a single record with a single field
$query = "SELECT author FROM books WHERE title = 'A Study In Scarlet'";
// execute query
$result = sqlite_query($handle, $query) or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
// if a row exists
if (sqlite_num_rows($result) > 0) {
	// get the value of the first field of the first row
	echo sqlite_fetch_single($result);
}
// all done
// close database file
sqlite_close($handle);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>You can even use the sqlite_fetch_single() function in combination
	with a while() loop to iterate over a result set containing many records
	but a single field. Notice also my usage of the sqlite_has_more()
	function, to check if the next row exists or not.</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set path of database file
$db = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/../library.db";
// open database file
$handle = sqlite_open($db) or die("Could not open database");
// generate query string
$query = "SELECT DISTINCT author FROM books";
// execute query
$result = sqlite_query($handle, $query) or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
// if rows exist
if (sqlite_num_rows($result) > 0) {
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	// check for more rows
	while (sqlite_has_more($result)) {
		// get first field from each row
		// print values
		$row = sqlite_fetch_single($result);
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>".$row."</td>";
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
}
// all done
// close database file
sqlite_close($handle);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>You can, of course, do the same thing using object notation in PHP 5. However,
	you need to know that sqlite_has_more() is one function that
	really doesn’t translate to its object method name; in an OO script, you
	would need to call $result-&gt;valid();.</p>
	<p>This script is the OO equivalent of the one above:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
// set path of database file
$file = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/../library.db";
// create database object
$db = new SQLiteDatabase($file) or die("Could not open database");
// generate query string
$query = "SELECT DISTINCT author FROM books";
// execute query
$result = $db->query($query) or die("Error in query");
// if rows exist
if ($result->numRows() > 0) {
	echo "<table cellpadding=10 border=1>";
	// check for more rows
	while ($result->valid()) {
		// get first field from each row
		// print values
		$row = $result->fetchSingle();
		echo "<tr>";
		echo "<td>".$row."</td>";  
		echo "</tr>";
	}
	echo "</table>";
}
// all done
// destroy database object
unset($db);
?>
</body>
</html>{% endhighlight %}
	
	<h2>Not my type</h2>
	<p>Whilst on the topic of INSERT, remember my statement a couple pages
	back about how SQLite is typeless and so you can insert values of any
	type into any field? There is one important exception to this rule: a
	field marked as INTEGER PRIMARY KEY. In SQLite, fields marked as
	INTEGER PRIMARY KEY do two important things: they provide a unique
	numeric identifier for each record in the table, and if you insert a
	NULL value into them, SQLite automatically inserts a value that is 1
	greater than the largest value already present in that field.</p>
	<p>INTEGER PRIMARY KEY fields in SQLite thus perform the equivalent of
	AUTO_INCREMENT fields in MySQL, and are a convenient way of
	automatically numbering your records. Obviously, you can’t insert
	non-numeric values into such a field, which is why I said they were an
	exception to the typeless rule. Read more about this at
	<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/datatypes.html">http://www.sqlite.org/datatypes.html</a>.</p>
	<p>Since the books table used in the previous example already contains
	such a field (the id field), it’s clear that every INSERT into it with a
	NULL value for that field generates a new record number. If you’d like
	to retrieve this number, PHP has a way to do that too – just use the
	sqlite_last_insert_rowid() function, which returns the ID of the
	last inserted row (equivalent to the mysql_insert_id() function
	in PHP’s MySQL API).</p>
	<p>To see this in action, update the if() loop in the middle of the
	previous script to include a call to sqlite_last_insert_rowid(), as
	follows:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// check to see if the form was submitted with a new record
if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
	// make sure both title and author are present
	if (!empty($_POST['title']) && !empty($_POST['author'])) {
		// generate INSERT query
		$insQuery = "INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES (\"".sqlite_escape_string($_POST['title'])."\", \"".sqlite_escape_string($_POST['author'])."\")";
		// execute query
		$insResult = sqlite_query($handle, $insQuery) or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
		// print success message
		echo "<i>Record successfully inserted with ID ".sqlite_last_insert_rowid($handle)."!</i><p />";
	} else {
		// missing data
		// display error message
		echo "<i>Incomplete form input. Record not inserted!</i><p />";
	}
}
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>If you need to, you can also find out how many rows were affected using
	the sqlite_changes() function – try it for yourself and see!</p>

	<h2>Starting from scratch</h2>
	<p>You’ll remember, from the beginning of this tutorial, that I suggested
	you initialize the library.db database using the SQLite
	commandline program. Well, that isn’t the only way to create a fresh
	SQLite database – you can use PHP itself to do this, by issuing the
	necessary CREATE TABLE and INSERT commands
	through the sqlite_query() function. Here’s how:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// set path of database file
$db = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/../library2.db";
// open database file
$handle = sqlite_open($db) or die("Could not open database");
// create database
sqlite_query($handle, "CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL)") or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
// insert records
sqlite_query($handle, "INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES ('The Lord Of The Rings', 'J.R.R. Tolkien')") or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
sqlite_query($handle, "INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES ('The Murders In The Rue Morgue', 'Edgar Allan Poe')") or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
sqlite_query($handle, "INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES ('Three Men In A Boat', 'Jerome K. Jerome')") or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
sqlite_query($handle, "INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES ('A Study In Scarlet', 'Arthur Conan Doyle')") or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
sqlite_query($handle, "INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES ('Alice In Wonderland', 'Lewis Carroll')") or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
// print success message
echo "<i>Database successfully initialized!";
// all done
// close database file
sqlite_close($handle);

	<p>Or, in PHP 5, you can use the object-oriented approach:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// set path of database file
$file = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/../library3.db";
// create database object
$db = new SQLiteDatabase($file) or die("Could not open database");
// create database
$db->query("CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL)") or die("Error in query");
// insert records
$db->query("INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES ('The Lord Of The Rings', 'J.R.R. Tolkien')") or die("Error in query");
$db->query("INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES ('The Murders In The Rue Morgue', 'Edgar Allan Poe')") or die("Error in query");
$db->query("INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES ('Three Men In A Boat', 'Jerome K. Jerome')") or die("Error in query");
$db->query("INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES ('A Study In Scarlet', 'Arthur Conan Doyle')") or die("Error in query");
$db->query("INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES ('Alice In Wonderland', 'Lewis Carroll')") or die("Error in query");
// print success message
echo "<i>Database successfully initialized!</i>";
// all done
// destroy database object
unset($db);
?>{% endhighlight %}
	
	<h2>A few extra tools</h2>
	<p>Finally, the SQLite API also includes some ancillary functions, to
	provide you with information on the SQLite version and encoding, and on
	the error code and message generated by the last failed operation. The
	following example demonstrates the sqlite_libversion() and
	sqlite_libencoding() functions, which return the version number
	and encoding of the linked SQLite library respectively:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// version
echo "SQLite version: ".sqlite_libversion()."<br />";
// encoding
echo "SQLite encoding: ".sqlite_libencoding()."<br />";
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>When things go wrong, reach for the sqlite_last_error()
	function, which returns the last error code returned by SQLite. Of
	course, this error code – a numeric value – is not very useful in
	itself; to convert it to a human-readable message, couple it with the
	sqlite_error_string() function. Consider the following
	example, which illustrates by attempting to run a query with a
	deliberate error in it:</p>
	{% highlight php %}<?php
// set path of database file
$db = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/../library.db";
// open database file
$handle = sqlite_open($db) or die("Could not open database");
// generate query string
// query contains a deliberate error
$query = "DELETE books WHERE id = 1";
// execute query
$result = sqlite_query($handle, $query) or die("Error in query: ".sqlite_error_string(sqlite_last_error($handle)));
// all done
// close database file
sqlite_close($handle);
?>{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Here’s what the output looks like:</p>
	<code><b>Warning</b>: sqlite_query() [<a href="#">function.sqlite-query</a>]: near "books": syntax error in <b>/var/www/part9-sqlite.php</b> on line <b>13</b>
Error in query: SQL logic error or missing database</code>
	<p>Note that although they might appear similar, the sqlite_last_error()
	and sqlite_error_string() functions don’t work in exactly the same way
	as the mysql_errno() and mysql_error() functions. The
	mysql_errno() and mysql_error() functions
	can be used independently of each other to retrieve the last error code
	and message respectively, but the sqlite_error_string() is dependent
	on the error code returned by sqlite_last_error().</p>
	<p>If your appetite has been whetted, you can read more about the things PHP can do
	with SQLite in Zend’s <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/php5/articles/php5-sqlite.php">PHP 5 In Depth</a> section.</p>
	<p>And that’s about all I have for you in this tutorial. More secrets await you in
